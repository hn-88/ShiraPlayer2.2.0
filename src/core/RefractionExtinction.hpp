// TODO USABILITY: add 4 more flags/switches in GUI:
// (boolean) refraction, [could be omitted and linked to global "show atmosphere"]
// (value field) Temperature [C] [influences refraction]
// (value field) Pressure [mbar]  [influences refraction]
// (combo)   extinction Coeff. k=0...(0.01)...1, [if k=0, no ext. effect]
// SUGGESTION: Could Temperature/Pressure/ex.Coeff./LightPollution be linked to the landscape files?

#include "VecMath.hpp"

//! @class RefractionExtinction
//! This class performs refraction and extinction computations, following literature from atmospheric optics and astronomy.
//! Airmass computations are limited to meaningful altitudes,
//! and refraction solutions can only be aproximate, given the turbulent, unpredictable real atmosphere.
//! The solution provided here will [hopefully!] result in a visible "zone of avoidance" near the horizon down to altitude -2,
//! and will show stars in their full brightness at their geometrical positions below -2 degrees.
//! Of course, plotting stars below the horizon could be coupled to setting of horizon foreground,
//! it's another usability issue. Typical horizons do not go down below -1, so -2 should leave a fair amount of room.
//! Note that forward/backward are no absolute reverse operations!
//! All the computations should be in effect
//! (1) only if atmosphere effects are true
//! (2) only for celestial objects, never for landscape coordinates
//! (3) only for terrestrial locations, not on Moon/Mars/Saturn etc
